RADIUS ensures hop to hop integrity by using\r\n   pre-shared secret between hops. End to end connection between NAS and\r\n   RADIUS server is through the set of transitive links involving\r\n   proxies. RADIUS over TLS can be deployed to have the security between\r\n   hop to hop only. Incase of Roaming scenarios, the NAS, proxies, and\r\n   home server will typically be managed by different administrative\r\n   entities. And Proxies have complete access to messages exchanged\r\n   between NAS and RADIUS Server.\r\n\r\n\r\nProblem Scenario\r\n\r\n   No end to end security in RADIUS. Security Mechanism like Radius over\r\n   TLS provides only Hop to Hop security. TLS involves additional\r\n   overhead of certificate maintenance and cost. As the proxy has the\r\n   right to modify the message, that introduces following security\r\n   threats [RFC2607].\r\n\r\n   Message editing\r\n   Attribute editing\r\n   Theft of password\r\n   Theft and modification of accounting data\r\n   Replay attacks\r\n   Connection hijacking\r\n   Fraudulent accounting.\r\n\r\n   Both NAS and RADIUS Server are not aware of the changes made in the\r\n   message by the proxies and assumed to be in trusted relationship with\r\n   proxies in Proxy chaining scenarios. This can cause havoc in roaming\r\n   environments.\r\n\r\n\r\nSolution\r\n\r\n   Introduce Security Attribute 'X' as a container to hold set of\r\n   sensitive attributes that need to be protected. Sensitive attributes\r\n   such as vlan, password,.. can be placed as sub TLVs. The attributes\r\n   that should not be modified by proxy can be also be placed in this\r\n   vendor specific attribute as sub-TLVs.\r\n\r\n   Configure pre-shared secret 'K' that is known only to NAS/RADIUS\r\n   Client and RADIUS Server.\r\n\r\n   Configure algorithm 'E' at NAS/RADIUS Client and RADIUS Server.\r\n   Algorithm can be any standard algorithm such as AES.\r\n\r\n   Configure Hashing algorithm 'H' at NAS/RADIUS Client and RADIUS\r\n   Server. Algorithm can be any standard algorithm such as SHA-1.\r\n\r\n   Hash the contents of Security Attribute X using the algorithm H and\r\n   append the hash as sub TLV. This ensures integrity of the message\r\n   that needs to be protected.\r\n\r\n   Encrypt the contents of Security Attribute X using the algorithm E\r\n   with the key K. This ensures confidentiality of the message that\r\n   needs to be protected.\r\n\r\n   Only the Security Attribute 'X' will be sent in the RADIUS Message\r\n   and the rest of parameters(K, E and H) will be configurations made at\r\n   NAS/RADIUS Client and RADIUS Server. \r\n\r\n\r\nAdvantages\r\n\r\n   Rogue Proxy cannot decrypt the protected Security Attribute contents.\r\n   Hence, security in Roaming scenarios is assured.\r\n\r\n   Concept of un-modifiable or protected attributes is introduced. With\r\n   this, it is possible to exchange sensitive attributes safely between\r\n   NAS/RADIUS Client and RADIUS Server.\r\n\r\n   Even if any Rogue proxy removes the Security Attribute, RADIUS server\r\n   or NAS can potentially drop the message as the Security Attribute is\r\n   expected in the message with respect to configuration.\r\n\r\n   Both NAS and RADIUS Server can safely assume the trust relationships\r\n   with proxies.\r\n\r\n   End to end security is accomplished with this mechanism.\r\n\r\n   Compared to TLS, this proposal ensures end to end security with less\r\n   cost and maintenance overhead.\r\n\r\n   Sensitive contents are protected from man in the middle.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\n  Normative References\r\n\r\n   [RFC2119]  Bradner, S., \"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate\r\n              Requirement Levels\", BCP 14, RFC 2119, March 1997.\r\n\r\n   [RFC2865]  Rigney, C., Willens, S., Rubens, A., and W.
